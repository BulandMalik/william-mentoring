# william-mentoring

This repository is about mentoring session b/w Buland (Mentor) and William (Mentee) as per the UTP Mentoring program.

We talked about that our focus is on the Front End Web Development so its better to know what type of job it is. [This link](https://www.coursera.org/articles/front-end-developer) will give more idea of what ois expected from Front End Engineers.

## Plan
Our plan is to cover the Frontend side of technologies for rest of our mentoring sessions. We will cover the following as per our agenda items.

1. [Source Control Systems](./sourcecontrolsystems/README.md)
2. [HTML + CSS](./html-css/README.md)
3. [Javascript Part 1](./javascript/README.md)
4. [Javascript Part 2 + Javascript Frameworks](./javascript/README.md)
